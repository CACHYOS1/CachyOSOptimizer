I'm new to bash scripting and optimizing hardware.
My goal is to make the best optimization for low end laptops.
I'll focus on raw performance, maybe in the future ill make other versions for battery life or fast boot.
If anyone wants to give suggestions or make request I would gladly accept any raccomendation or question.
Hope you will appriciate my efforts
