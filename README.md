# CachyOSOptimizer
it's a rough optimizer for cachy os, trying to make it work for all linux systems.
This is an optimizer that aims to improve performance on weak laptops. 
I'm sure that someone will find this usefull one day.
Hope you will appreciate my effort.

I'm not a professional, I barely know what I'm doing. I have some hope this project might become something real.

Thank you all.
